Version 0.2a  2011-03-???
    Major API changes:
    * stats has now been split up into a package with separate sub-modules.
    * Single-pass versions of variance and friends have been re-written as
      coroutines.
    * Running the package from the command line runs all doctests. See
      `python3 -m stats --help` for further details.
    * The test suite is now officially excluded from the public API.
    * However, and subject to change, you can run the full test suite
      with `python3 -m stats._tests`.
    * Renamed stderrskewness and stderrkurtosis to sterrskewness and
      sterrkurtosis for consistancy with stdev and sterrmean.
    * Replaced hinges function with Tukey's fivenum summary.

    Performance improvements:
    * Processing iterators are now about 25% faster.

    New functionality:
    * Many functions have been vectorized (will operate on columns of data
      in a single function call).
    * Support for alternative definitions of median (e.g. "social sciences
      median", "low median", and others.)

    Notable bug fixes:
    * Fixed the issue with quantile scheme #3.  <<<------ FIXME

    Known issues:
    * Unconfirmed reports that the Windows binary installer does not work.


Version 0.1.2a  2010-12-31
    * Clean up most functions.
    * Added six new statistics functions:
      midhinge, quartile_skewness, cumulative_sum, running_sum,
      stderrskewness, stderrkurtosis
    * Hinges are now also available as a dedicated function, as well as
      via the quartile function.
    * Emulate all nine of R's quantile types, plus one that R doesn't
      include, plus Mathematica's parameterized quantiles.
    * The private module containing quantile code has been merged with
      the main module. Apart from tests, all code is (temporarily) now
      in one file.
    * Many more tests. There are now more lines of code in the tests than in
      the library (approx. 2:1 excluding docstrings, blanks and comments.)
    * skew renamed to skewness.
    * qcorr now returns NAN if all the data points lie on the medians,
      and raises an exception if there are no data points.
    * sum, product and friends now include an optional start argument,
      similar to the built-in sum function.
    * Many enhancements and bug fixes, too many to list.

    Known issues:
    * Test coverage is better, but still incomplete.
    * Executable examples and more documentation are needed.
    * Quantile scheme #3 doesn't match the parameterized version.
    * This will be the last version in a single module. The next version
      will (re-)introduce a package structure, which will give more
      flexibility and a better UI.
    * Expect some API changes in the next version.
    * Still a question mark over the Windows binary installer.


Version 0.1.1a  2010-11-14
    Many changes since the initial release:
    * The project has a home page outside of PyPI:
      http://code.google.com/p/pycalcstats/
    * stats is now aimed at Python 3.1 or better. Support functions for
      older versions have been removed.
    * Many more statistics functions.
    * Tests are now worthy of the name.
    * Serious numerical instability in variance and standard deviation
      due to use of a naive algorithm has been corrected. (Thanks to Kurt
      Smith for spotting this).
    * I now know more about quartiles than I ever hoped to learn :(

    Known issues:
    * This is still alpha software. The API is not yet locked down: function
      signatures or even names may still change.
    * Many more tests are required. Test coverage is good, but incomplete.
    * Multivariate functions including cov, corr and linr are still painfully
      naive and need work.
    * Better documentation, including executable examples.
    * Quantile-related functions are split off into a private module, but
      without the full package structure. I'm not sure this is the right way
      to do it.
    * Not all quartile/quantile modes are supported yet, or fully debugged.
    * Windows binary installer appears to be broken.

    Thanks also to Geremy Condra for his efforts.
