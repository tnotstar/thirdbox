To start Pion, just run the ".\start_pion.bat" script from a command prompt.
This will setup your environment paths and start the Pion server executable.

Once the server is running, open your favorite web browser (Firefox, Safari
or IE7) and point it to the following URL:
http://localhost:8888

This will open the Pion user interface to the "Reactors configuration" page.

To stop Pion, type Ctrl-C if it is running in the foreground, or
"killall pion" if it is running in the background.

This release has the following limitations:

a) If you drag a reactor over top an existing reactor within the workspace,
   it sometimes becomes un-droppable.  Drag around existing reactors instead.

b) You must hit <enter> after making any changes within the user interface
   configuration grids.  If you hit the "save" button before hitting <enter>,
   your change will not be saved.

c) You must stop, and then start some Reactors for them to recognize certain
   configuration changes.
