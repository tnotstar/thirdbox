How to do a Dojo custom build of the Pion UI:

* JDK must be installed.

* Bring pion.profile.js up to date, with any new required modules or prefixes added
  and paths changed if needed.

* Make sure a source version of Dojo is installed at C:\dojo-release-1.3.2-src\.
  (If not, download http://download.dojotoolkit.org/current-dev/dojo-release-1.3.2-src.zip
  and extract it into C:, or get it from Subversion:
  http://svn.dojotoolkit.org/src/tags/release-1.3.2/)

* Run build.bat, which calls C:\dojo-release-1.3.2-src\util\buildscripts\build.bat
  with the appropriate parameters, and with pion.profile.js in the right place.
  This results in a release folder C:\dojo-release-1.3.2-src\release\dojo-release.

* Run copy-subset.bat, to copy a sufficient subset of files from the release folder 
  to the local release folder (ui/dojo-release), overwriting the current files.

* Make sure that the local release folder is actually sufficient, by trying to open 
  the Pion UI in a browser.  copy-subset.bat might occasionally need to be updated 
  to reflect new required files.  (Updating might also be desirable to remove more 
  unneeded files.  In this case, files that are longer being copied will have to be 
  manually deleted from the repository, since the local dojo-release is under source 
  control.)

* Once the new local dojo-release is ready, commit any files that have changed,
  including any additions or deletions.
