Detailed build instructions are available for all of the platforms
supported by Pion within the "common/doc" subdirectory (README.platform).
Please read these instructions first.

Build and installation summary:

# ./configure [--with-openssl] [--with-log4cxx]
# make all
# make check	(this will build and run Pion's unit tests)
# make install	(this may require superuser/Administrator privileges)

Starting with 0.5.6, Pion REQUIRES the Boost C++ libraries (version 1.35.0
or greater). Please see the README.boost file within the "common/doc"
subdirectory for instructions on how to download, build and install Boost.

For logging, Pion may be configured to:

a) use std::cout and std::cerr for logging (the default configuration)
b) use one of the following open source libraries: log4cxx, log4cpp or
   log4cplus (configure using one of --with-log4cxx, --with-log4cpp or
   --with-log4cplus, respectively)
c) disable logging entirely (configure --disable-logging)
