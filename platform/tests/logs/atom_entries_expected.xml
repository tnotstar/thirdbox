		<content>&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has been on a downward spiral ever since the DOJ &lt;a href=&quot;http://money.cnn.com/2000/06/07/technology/microsoft_chronology/&quot;&gt;rained on its monopoly parade&lt;/a&gt; in 2000, causing Bill Gates to &lt;a href=&quot;http://money.cnn.com/2000/01/13/technology/microsoft/&quot;&gt;pass the reigns&lt;/a&gt; over to Steve Ballmer.  Since then, nearly every major effort at Microsoft has turned out to be a failure. While the S&amp;amp;P 500 has since gained over 40% in value, Microsoft&amp;#8217;s stock has remained stagnant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than &amp;#8220;Chief Executive Officer,&amp;#8221; a more appropriate title for Ballmer would probably be &amp;#8220;Chief of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear%2C_uncertainty_and_doubt&quot;&gt;FUD&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#8221;  Linux and other open source software has grown to become a major competitive force in the marketplace, displacing Microsoft&amp;#8217;s market share by offering far better technology at much lower costs.  In response, Ballmer has called Linux a &amp;#8220;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/06/02/ballmer_linux_is_a_cancer/&quot;&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;#8221; and spread ridiculous lies such as, &amp;#8220;if you use any open-source software, you have to make the rest of your software open source.&amp;#8221;  I guess that nowadays, innovating is just too difficult for Redmond.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content>&lt;p&gt;I received my shiny new 8-core Mac Pro today, and boy is it FAST!  I&amp;#8217;ve been working lately on a C++ project in Xcode (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atomiclabs.com/libpion&quot;&gt;libpion&lt;/a&gt;).  It&amp;#8217;s new and therefore was already building fairly quickly on my MacBook Pro.  But on my new machine I hit &amp;#8220;build&amp;#8221;, watch all eight CPU bars jump up, and then &amp;#8212; almost instantly &amp;#8212; it&amp;#8217;s done.  I haven&amp;#8217;t been this excited about a new tech toy since Santa gave me (the original) Game Boy for Christmas!  =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my last post on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mikedickey.com/2007/04/14/mac-virtual-machines/&quot;&gt;Mac Virtual Machines&lt;/a&gt;, I ran a few tests to compare VMware Fusion &amp;amp; Parallels for Mac.  Eric pointed out a few tips in his comments that he felt would help improve the accuracy of these tests, so I decided to run them again on my new toy.&lt;/p&gt;
