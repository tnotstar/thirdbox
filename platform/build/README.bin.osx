This will start the Pion server and open a log window on your desktop.
Once the server is running, open your (Firefox or Safari) web browser and
point it to the following URL:  http://localhost:8888

This will open the Pion user interface to the "Reactors configuration" page.

This release has the following limitations:

a) If you drag a reactor over top an existing reactor within the workspace,
   it sometimes becomes un-droppable.  Drag around existing reactors instead.

b) You must hit <enter> after making any changes within the user interface
   configuration grids.  If you hit the "save" button before hitting <enter>,
   your change will not be saved.

c) You must stop, and then start some Reactors for them to recognize certain
   configuration changes.
