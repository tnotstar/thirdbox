= About the Statlib Package =

*A collection of pure python descriptive statistics and vector algebra.*

Homepage: http://python-statlib.googlecode.com

The goal of the project is to combine several python statistics 
modules into a single package. This is the result of a project 
that has been run under the auspices of the 2007 Python Project 
for the Google Highly Open Participation Contest, a programming 
contest for high school students.
